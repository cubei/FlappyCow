0.	You should have the Android SDK installed and download important stuff via SDK Manager
	I suggest you use an IDE like Eclipse (Android Studio will work too, but I didn't try)

1.	Clone this repository to your local disk.
	git clone https://github.com/cubei/FlappyCow.git

2.	Open your IDE (with a new workspace)

3.	<Import Android Code> -> choose the cloned folder "FlappyCow"

4.	Get rid of the the ad errors.
	Choose one option: a or b

	a)	The ads need the Google Play Services.
		You can set up a library project like this: https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/
		Android Studio should have this already built in.

	b)	Remove the ads
		Go into the AndroidManifest.xml and delete the ad related stuff. They should be marked as error.
		Now you will see only remaining errors in the Game.java file.
		Delete the faulty lines in setLayouts(), onResume() and the ad imports.

5.	Enjoy the code.
